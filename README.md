## Overview

Nyntax is an exciting word chain game where two players compete to create valid English words while following specific rules. Each player must think quickly, use their vocabulary wisely, and manage their points strategically to win!

## Game Rules

### Basic Gameplay

- **Two Players**: Take turns to submit valid English words
- **Word Chain**: Each word must start with the last letter of the previous word
- **Time Pressure**: You have **15 seconds** to submit your word
- **Minimum Length**: All words must be at least **4 characters** long
- **No Repeats**: Words cannot be reused by either player

### Scoring System

Points are deducted based on word length and timing:

| Word Length        | Timer > 5s | Timer â‰¤ 5s |
| ------------------ | ---------- | ---------- |
| **8+ characters**  | -13 points | -10 points |
| **< 8 characters** | -8 points  | -8 points  |

### Winning Conditions

- Game ends when any player reaches **0 points**
- The other player is declared the winner
- Both players start with **150 points**

### Timer Rules

- **15-second countdown** for each turn
- **Timer expires**: Automatic "Pass" added to history, turn switches
- **Text cleared**: Input field is cleared when timer runs out
- **Visual feedback**: Timer turns red when â‰¤ 3 seconds remain

### Invalid Submissions

The following will show an error and keep you on your turn:

## React Compiler

The React Compiler is not enabled on this template because of its impact on dev & build performances. To add it, see [this documentation](https://react.dev/learn/react-compiler/installation).

## Expanding the ESLint configuration

If you are developing a production application, we recommend using TypeScript with type-aware lint rules enabled. Check out the [TS template](https://github.com/vitejs/vite/tree/main/packages/create-vite/template-react-ts) for information on how to integrate TypeScript and [`typescript-eslint`](https://typescript-eslint.io) in your project.
